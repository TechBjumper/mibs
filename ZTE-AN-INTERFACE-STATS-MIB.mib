            "A count of frames received on a particular
             interface that are an integral number of octets
             in length but do not pass the FCS check.  This
             count does not include frames received with
             frame-too-long or frame-too-short error.

             The count represented by an instance of this
             object is incremented when the frameCheckError
             status is returned by the MAC service to the
             LLC (or other MAC user). Received frames for
             which multiple error conditions pertain are,
             according to the conventions of IEEE 802.3
             Layer Management, counted exclusively according
             to the error status presented to the LLC.

             Note:  Coding errors detected by the physical
             layer for speeds above 10 Mb/s will cause the
             frame to fail the FCS check.

             For interfaces operating at 10 Gb/s, this
             counter can roll over in less than 5 minutes if
             it is incrementing at its maximum rate.  Since
             that amount of time could be less than a

             to avoid a loss of information, a management
             station is advised to poll the
             dot3HCStatsFCSErrors object for 10 Gb/s or
             faster interfaces.

             Discontinuities in the value of this counter can
